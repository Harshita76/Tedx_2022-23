                'Ephemeral Panorama' captures the fleeting essence of the vast
                and vivid human experience that we partake in throughout our
                lives. The objective of the theme is to display the wide
                landscape of the emotions, ideas, and episodes we face, which
                are momentary and yet inspire change to shape us into who we
                are. The lack of permanence in our thoughts, the swift change in
                knowledge, and a slower shift of wisdom show the brilliance of
                the transient nature of the lives we lead. In this altering
                panorama, we are often forced to re-examine our decisions and
                adapt for a newer goal with ever-shifting circumstances. The
                theme symbolizes the nature of impressions on our minds, and how
                they shape science, art, sports, and culture in incremental
                ways, urging us to see the big picture in the temporary moments
                of inspiration.
